    to c:\Libraries\js

08) This step is currently not required!
    Obtain freetype 2.6 from http://freetype.org/ and extract it into
    C:\Libraries\freetype-2.6.
    Then build the freetye project in
    C:\Libraries\freetype-2.6\builds\windows\vc2010\freetype.sln in
    Configuration=Release Multithreaded.

09) This step is currently not required!

10) This step is currently not required!
    Obtain the stable version of libRocket from
    https://github.com/libRocket/libRocket/tree/stable and extract it into
    C:\Libraries\libRocket

11) This step is currently not required!
    Build libRocket solutions using cmake:
    Enter C:\Libraries\libRocket\Build directory and execute
    cmake . -DFREETYPE_LIBRARY=C:\Libraries\freetype-2.6\objs\vc2010\Win32\freetype26MT.lib -DFREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS=C:\Libraries\freetype-2.6\include

12) This step is currently not required!
    Open the libRocket.sln created in step 11 and build RocketCore,
    RocketControls and RockedDebugger in
    Configuration=Release

13) Obtain the HLAE source code from http://advancedfx.org and extract it into a
    folder you like.

14) Obtain the SharpDX SDK 2.6.3 from
    https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX/releases/tag/2.6.3
    and extract it into a folder named "SharpDX" in the same folder where the
    HLAE source code folder is located.

15) Compile and run the ShaderBuilder project (requires the SharpDX SDK) and
    compile the following Shaders to the "shaders\build" folder:
    - shaders\afxHook_splinerope_ps2x.fxc:
      - to afxHook_splinerope_ps20 (profile ps_2_0)
      - to afxHook_splinerope_ps20b (profile ps_2_b)
    - shaders\afxHook_splinecard_vsxx.fxc:
      - to afxHook_splinecard_vs20 (profile vs_2_0)
    - shaders\afxHook_spritecard_vsxx.fxc:
      - to afxHook_spritecard_vs20 (profile vs_2_0)
    - shaders\afxHook_spritecard_ps2x.fxc:
      - to afxHook_spritecard_ps20 (profile ps_2_0)
      - to afxHook_spritecard_ps20b (profile ps_2_b)
    - shaders\afxHook_vertexlit_and_unlit_generic_ps2x.fxc:
      - to afxHook_vertexlit_and_unlit_generic_ps20 (profile ps_2_0)
      - to afxHook_vertexlit_and_unlit_generic_ps20b (profile ps_2_b)
      - to afxHook_vertexlit_and_unlit_generic_ps30 (profile ps_3_0)
    The .h and .acs files build this way are required by the AfxHookSource
    project.

16) Open mdt.sln in the HLAE source code and Build (Configuration=Release):
    AfxHookGoldSrc, AfxHookSource, AfxCppCli

17) AfxHook\recompile.bat, move AfxHook.dat into build\Release\bin\

18) Build AfxGui (Release), move and rename AfxGui.exe to
    build\Release\bin\HLAE.exe

19) Use copy_resources_release.bat to copy required files and folders to the
    "build\Release\bin" folder.

20) Copy msvcp100.dll, msvcr100.dll (CRT runtime, required by C++ and C++/CLI
    projects) from your system folders (on 64 bit systems in C:\Windows\SysWOW64
    on 32 bit systems in C:\Windows\system32) to build\Release\bin
    Make sure to select the correct folder as suggested above, so that you end
    up with the 32 bit binaries.

21) This step is not required by default, only when you plan to build AfxHookGoldSrc with AFX_SCRIPT!
    Copy mozjs-24.dll from C:\Libraries\js\bin to build\Release\bin

22) This step is currently not required!
    Copy RocketCore.dll, RocketControls.dll from
    C:\Libraries\libRocket\Build\Release to build\Release\bin

23) Packaging the final .zip file is not trivial (selecting only the files required),
    if you are using a default built, use the latest download as template :-)
