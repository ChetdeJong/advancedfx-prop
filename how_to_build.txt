For building HLAE you will need Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and Microsoft Visual
C# 2010, which you can obtain for free from http://www.microsoft.com (Express
editions will do).

Build order:

1) Download the Half-Life SDK from
   http://metamod.sourceforge.net/files/sdk/hlsdk-2.3-p3.zip
   and install it into C:\Libraries\hlsdk

2) Build (Configuration=Release): AfxHookGoldSrc, AfxHookSource, AfxCppCli

3) AfxHook\recompile.bat, move AfxHook.dat into build\Release\bin\

4) Build AfxGui (Release), move and rename AfxGui.exe to
   build\Release\bin\HLAE.exe

5) Copy all files and folders from resources\ to build\Release\bin,
   you can use copy_resources_release.bat in order to do that.

6) Copy msvcp100.dll, msvcr100.dll (CRT runtime, required by C++ and C++/CLI
   projects) from your system folders to build\Release\bin

7) Remove all temporary / unneeded files such as *.pdb and hlaeconfig.xml
