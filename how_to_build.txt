Hint:
  In case some of the required downloads are not reachable, we have a backup
  here:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/advancedfx/files/developer/build-tools/

01) Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and Microsoft Visual
    C# 2010, which you can obtain for free from http://www.microsoft.com (Express
    editions will do).

02) _After that_ download and install Micrsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1,
    which you can obtain for free from http://www.microsoft.com

03) Download the Half-Life SDK from
    http://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife
    and install it into C:\Libraries\halflife

04) This step is not required by default, only when you plan to build AfxHookGoldSrc with AFX_SCRIPT!
    Download the Mozilla Build Environment from
    http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe
    and install it into a folder you like.

05) This step is not required by default, only when you plan to build AfxHookGoldSrc with AFX_SCRIPT!
    Download the Mozilla SpiderMonkey (JS) library from
    http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/mozjs-24.2.0.tar.bz2
    and extract it into a folder you like.

06) This step is not required by default, only when you plan to build AfxHookGoldSrc with AFX_SCRIPT!
    Compile the SpiderMonkey (JS) library using the Mozilla Build Environment
    ( start-msvc10.bat ) using the following commands:
    cd path_to_js_library/js/src
    autoconf-2.13
    ./configure
    make

07) This step is not required by default, only when you plan to build AfxHookGoldSrc with AFX_SCRIPT! 
    Copy the contents of the created JS dist folder (js/src/build-release/dist
    to c:\Libraries\js

08) Obtain the HLAE source code from http://advancedfx.org and extract it into a
    folder you like.

09) Open mdt.sln in the HLAE source code and Build (Configuration=Release):
    AfxHookGoldSrc, AfxHookSource, AfxCppCli

10) AfxHook\recompile.bat, move AfxHook.dat into build\Release\bin\

11) Build AfxGui (Release), move and rename AfxGui.exe to
   build\Release\bin\HLAE.exe

12) Copy all files and folders from resources\ to build\Release\bin,
    you can use copy_resources_release.bat in order to do that.

13) Copy msvcp100.dll, msvcr100.dll (CRT runtime, required by C++ and C++/CLI
    projects) from your system folders (C:\Windows\system32) to build\Release\bin

14) This step is not required by default, only when you plan to build AfxHookGoldSrc with AFX_SCRIPT!
   Copy mozjs-24.dll from C:\Libraries\js\bin to build\Release\bin

15) Packaging the final .zip file is not trivial (selecting only the files required),
    if you are using a default built, use the latest download as template :-)
