HLAE 2.2.5.15 (2009-09-25T11:11Z)

* removed "-demoedit" from the default launch options
  since it may cause high memory usage, performance hits
  and instabilty, while only a share of HLAE users use it
  
* improved skymanager:
  now supports a few .tga formats (24/32bit color uncompressed),
  flat mode single click selects image / sky,
  flat mode double click imports image

Thanks to: Joakim, juGGaKNot, msthavoc


HLAE 2.2.5.14 (2009-09-01T07:26Z)

* added mirv_camimport_* features from HLAE BETA branch

HLAE 2.2.5.1 (2009-04-13)

* polished Sky Manger


HLAE 2.2.5.0 (2009-04-13)

* added HLAE Sky Manager, located in Tools menu,

* mirv_fx_skyhd: fixed 24rgb bitmap loading bug

* mirv_fx_skyhd:
  1 - load sky from files (HLAE Sky Manger + Terragen compatible)
  2 - for loading old HLAE skies
  
Thx to msthavoc and juGGaKNot for testing.

  
HLAE 2.2.3.6 (2009-02-13)

* improved mirv_voice_block
  
* changed IDE to VC++ 2008 Express Ed.

* fixed private side by side CRT assembly version mismatch
  

HLAE 2.2.3.4 (2009-02-05)

* fixed and improved mirv_crosshair_fps (cstrike crosshair fix):
  - it should be accurate now
  - when enabled there should be no difference between hudalpha and hudcolor
    streams
  For more information read the online manual / command reference.


HLAE 2.2.3.3 (2009-01-29)

* fixed bug with selection of custom mods (thx to Fana)


HLAE 2.2.3.2 (2009-01-25)

* changed mirv_movie_separate_hud (should fix missing awp ch problem)


HLAE 2.2.3.1 (2009-01-19)

* added mirv_movie_bmp,
  if set to 1 mirv will export Windows V3 bitmaps (.bmp)
  instead of tgas with best effort

* tweaked TGA header output (palette entry size as suggested by msthavoc)

* changed launcher: made selection of custom mods more obvious again


HLAE 2.2.2.0 (2009-01-04)

* added mirv_noadverts, replaces and fixes mirv_movie_noadverts
  In order for this to work the map must be loaded / you must be ingame

* added mirv_decalfilter

* added crappy calculator to the tools menu

* internal tweaks

Greetings:
  Anthony Perfetto (style-productions.net)


HLAE 2.2.1.0 (2008-11-15)

* added cstrike crosshair fix:
  
  mirv_crosshair_fps n
    set n to the fps (sps in case you use the sampling system)
    you will be recording your movie at.
    
    Related debug command: __mirv_crosshair_base_fps
    (HLAE / Mirv will scale the crosshair cool-down from
    __mirv_crosshair_base_fps to mirv_crosshair_fps)

  Well you wanted it, there you have it.

* various tweaks

* restored mirv_playercolors_cs
  (In case no one claims to use this command we'll most likely remove
  it sooner or later, since updating it is a mess :)

Greetings:
  Mirvin_Monkey (where ever you may sneak around)
  FragMonkey, juGGaKNot, msthavoc
  S.o. related to 1999-2001 (I am not 100% sure who is who).


HLAE 2.1.6.0 (2008-11-10)

* added crappy check to the launcher if HL is already running

* fixed potential flaw that could lead to matte color not being
  reforced as glClearColor (thanks to user "yes.")
  
* added possibility for other tools (i.e. demo players) to interface
  with HLAE. This feature will be documented in the HLAEwiki
  online manual in the appendix section (including source code)


HLAE 2.1.5.13 (2008-11-02)

* fixed wrong p_playermove_s address:
  (affects aiming system and 1st person detection in fixforcehltv mode)


HLAE 2.1.5.12 (2008-10-29)

* fixed bug that would invert the fullscreen checkbox behavior


HLAE 2.1.5.11 (2008-10-28)

* fixed mirv_fx_noblend address
* re-added temporary fullscreen option (use with care,
  might go away in the future again)


HLAE 2.1.5.10 (2008-10-27)

* changed behavior upon game connecting to a server
  (More safety for those that prefer working airbags in case sanity fails. :)


HLAE 2.1.5.9

Updating is recommended!

* fixed miscalculated p_r_refdef value for in the mdt_addresses.ini
  that could cause a crash upon recording
  
Thanks to "spunge" for reporting the bug on the forums
and helping us debugging it down! :)


HLAE 2.1.5.8 (2008-10-25)

* updated addresses (second 2008-10-24 Steam HL1 Engine update)

Greetings:
  Mirvin_Monkey, FragMonkey and 5.5.

Thanks to:
  juGGaKNot (HLAE Team) and msthavoc (HLAE Team)
  for helping with testing.

Tip:
  You can also use FragMonkeys COL DemoPlayer to convert old demos:
  http://lacomplexity.thecgs.com/coL_16_Player_-_Update_Proof
  HLAE has such a feature too, but it is not 100% complete yet and
  might not work in some cases.


HLAE 2.1.5.6 (2008-10-25)

* rolls out the .NET 2.0 based launcher (former 2008-10-19 beta)
  Thus Microsoft .NET 2.0 framework is required.

* updated hooking functions and addresses system
  (2008-10-24 Steam HL1 Engine update)

Please note:
  mirv_playercolors_cs might be temporarily inavailable


HLAE 2.1.0.1 (2008-10-14)

+ simplified mirv_movie_depthdump behavior (moved old logic to
  new deug command __mirv_depth_bpp)
  
* added __mirv_depth_bpp

* added mirv_depth_streams, allows to mask out streams


HLAE 2.1.0.0 (2008-09-28)

* fixed potential flaws related to the matte system,
  thus upgrading is recommended

- removed mirv_movie_oldmatte

* Improved the wallhack / vision extension.
  Users should notice complete visibility of players for HLTV demos
  when using the wh effect i.e. (the way it was intended to be in the first
  place :)

+ added mirv_fx_xtendvis, default 0
  Can be used to extend the vision (i.e. useful for HLTV demos)
  when mirv_wh_enable is 0, otherwise it will be overridden.

+ added mirv_matte_xray, default 0
  If enabled elements otherwise masked (i.e. walls) will be completely hidden
  from the entity stream
  could be useful in combination with mirv_fx_xtendvis!

+ extended mirv_movie_swapweapon: 2 will force it to the entity stream
  
Check HLAE's Command Reference in the online manual for more information
(see http://advancedfx.org/ ).


HLAE 2.0.3.0 (2008-09-18)

* Added ability to block screen blends: mirv_fx_noblend 1
  This will i.e. block Counter-Strike 1.6 flash grenades.

* appended historical changelogs to the changelog

CU in November or somewhen.
Thx to 'juggaknot' for having helped moderating the forum a bit.
PS: MIRVIN_Monkey rulz!


HLAE 2.0.2.3 (2008-08-17)

* removed coded that was probably never used in practical operation
  that would support reading from other buffers than GL_BACK
  
* when splitstreams is 2 the world frame that still gets rendered for
  technical reasons is not displayed anymore to avoid user confusion


HLAE 2.0.2.2 (2008-08-10)

* added mirv_disable_specmenu 0|1
  Supported modifications: ag, tfc, ns, valve(Half-Life)
  The mods cstrike and dod are not supported since they don't use the old
  specmenu and i.e. for cstrike the specmenu can be hidden by modifying a
  .res file (see various game movie making sites for more info).

* removed mirv_tfc_specmenu command which is replaced by mirv_disable_specmenu


HLAE 2.0.2.1 (2008-08-01)

* improved dem_forcehltv 1 fix behaviour: the player that recorded the
  in-eye demo may also now be seen from other's in-eye as users would
  expect from the fix

* fixed typo / bug that would waste rendering time and might enable depth
  comparison in unwanted situations
  
* removed unused output panel in old public gui


HLAE 2.0.2.0 (2008-07-25)

Thanks to Martin Vaissie for beta testing.

There was no time for spell checking this changelog entry, sorry.

* Added EXPERIMENTAL sampling system (main image stream only)
  A short description is appended bellow, a more extended description
  can be found in the HLAE Wiki (not finished yet) in Manual named
  'Sampling System' soon.

The sampling system only works when no additional image streams
  are enabled. (At least for now)

mirv_movie_fps
  determines the fps outputted (default 30)

mirv_sample_enable
  0: disabled (default)
  1: enable test sampling system

mirv_sammple_sps
  Samples Per Second, this is the FPS the game
  will be captured at (default 180)

__mirv_sample_smethod
  Integral approximation method
  0: 1 point (rectangle)
  1: 2 point (trapezoid) (default)

__mirv_sample_ffunc
  FrameFunction, rates the significance of a sample based on
  when in relation to the middle of the frame it comes in
  0: const / rectangle (default)
  1: gauss like (linearly interpolated table with 2*128 entries)

__mirv_sample_colorh
  0: RedGreenBlue are handled independent (default)
  1: RGB are equally scaled by their average (not sure why I added this)
  2: RGB are equally scaled by their sRGB Luma value (not sure why I added this)

__mirv_sample_addoverlap
  Additionally overlaps the frames.
  Actually this makes sense for the gauss frame function only
  in my opinion (you might want to add 1-2 additionally here for gauss),

  
Greetz:
  Martin Vaissie


HLAE 2.0.1.8 (2008-07-15)

* removed __mirv_movie_fpscap - fps are not capped anymore by default, users
  may now set as they want or till the program blows up or causes a division
  by zero error :)
  
* matte system changes:
  The matte system has undergone slight internal changes in oder to prepare
  planned features and also to fix the annoyances / problems of the
  previous implementations


HLAE 2.0.1.7 (2008-05-05)

* Added mirv_tfc_specmenu - allows to disable and enable spectator menu in Team Fortress Classic


HLAE 2.0.1.6 (2008-05-03)

* Added mirv_matte_entities to improve and thus replace mirv_movie_onlyentity,
  enter mirv_matte_entities into console for more info.
  
* Removed mirv_movie_onlyentity

* Fixed typo in launcher that would cause problems when launching TFC mod


HLAE 2.0.1.5 (2008-04-29)

* linked MS VC++ Runtime to the hlae.exe to avoid users being unable
  to launch HLAE (They saw the error message "This application has failed
  to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling
  the application may fix this problem.")
  Not the nicest way to fix this, but does it for now.
  Thx to azrazr for testing.


HLAE 2.0.1.4 (2008-04-27)

* Fixed -hlaealpha8 not working
* Added __mirv_movie_fpscap
    1: default
    0: disables the 1000 fps cap on mirv_movie_fps for testing purposes

Greetz and thanks to:
  MN|VadoskiN, juGGaKNot, you.


HLAE 2.0.1.3 (2008-04-21)

* Improved behaviour of 'Undock' capture mode.
* Fixed game behaviour when window is deactivated (i.e. due to windows key,
  etc.).


HLAE 2.0.1.2 (2008-04-19)

Fixed:
  Bug that affect performance when using FBO (still bad FPS after filming
  was stopped in case switching FBOs is slow on the gfx card).


HLAE 2.0.1.1 (2008-04-17)

Added missing file to download, in case you already downloaded 2.0.1
please re-download!
Sorry : )


HLAE 2.0.1.0 (2008-04-17)

This is release is mainly for making the HLAE Gui more reliable, thus we'll
also stop offering two different versions (stable and pre-release). 

Added:
  Support for rendering to other targets than the default window buffer.
  The most important one is EXT_framebuffer_object, which allows off-screen
  rendering for cards that support it:
  This fixes problems with missing contents in the capture (i.e. due parts of
  the window not being visible), which especially happened to NVIDIA card
  users.
  The new target(s) can be selected from the HLAE File->Launch dialog.

Added:
  HLAE hooks the connect command, to warn the user in case the user selects to
  join a server while HLAE is running (which is strongly not recommended).
  HLAE may fetch some but not all attempts, so as always: better count on your
  brain before you have to count on the airbag ;)

Added:
  -hlaealpha8 launchoption
  This is only relevant in case you capture the hud_alpha stream atm.
  It's not required in case you already use EXT_framebuffer_object.
  If you don't have problems with the hud_alpha stream, don't use this option.
  
Added:
  Icon (thx to guys that programed Inkscape and GIMP 2)

Renamed:
  mirv_placyercolors to mirv_placercolors_cs

Removed:
  __mirv_movie_oldcapture, mirv_movie_customdump, mirv_menu
  
Thanks to:
   msthavoc and MN|vadoskin for testing
   neomic and ripieces for coding
   Valve for not suing us( yet).
   The HLAE forum users for their creative input, we hope we'll
   be able to add at least some of the things being suggested in the future,
   but we won't promise anything( as always).


HLAE 2.0.0.3 (2008-04-06)

+ Adapted HLAE to the 2008-04-14 H-L engine update
  (updated mdt_addresses.ini)


HLAE 2.0.0.2 (2008-04-06)

This time we got some colors for L. 'spunge' M.:

Added: mirv_playercolors
  This allows to control the hudtext player colors per playerid.
  For each playerid the following colors can be controlled independently:
    attacker's deathnotice color,
    victim's deathnotice color,
    head-up color (overview + playername head-up).
  For more information enter the command into console or see HLAE wiki.


HLAE 2.0.0.0 pre-release (2008-03-21)

As always the following text contains many mistakes (as most changelog
entries) due to lack of time and dedication to writing changelogs.

- Changed: The MDT project has now been renamed to
           Half-Life Advanced Effects (HLAE)

- Added: The HLAE Graphical User Interface, which will be extended in the
         future. The GUI is based on wxWidgets ( http://www.wxwidgets.org/ ).
         
- Changed: The MDTloader has been integrated into the HLAE Gui.
           Select File->Launch from the menu to bring it up.

- Added: DemoTools: select Tools->Demo Tool form the menu.
         This tool migrates 2 old tools into the GUI:
         DemoCleanup by MirvinMonkey:
           Remove scoreboard, commandmenu, ...
           Added ability to block other commands too.
         Half-Life Demo Fix by ripieces:
           Repair demos that were recorded while the game crashed.
           Added ability to repair more than 2 segments.
         And adds a new one:
         dem_forcehltv 1 camera stuck fix:
           Tries to fix the camera being stuck when using dem_forcehltv 1
           with some in-eye demos.
           
- Added: mirv_voice_block (for John 'VAFarmboy' D.)
         this command allows blocking the voice data of specific players

- Changed: mirv_fixforcehltv defaults to 0 again, mirv will try to autodetect
           the dem_forcehltv setting and set fixforcehltv accordingly

- Added: command hooks: dem_forcehltv, startmovie, endmovie

- Added: __mirv_listplayers, __mirv_debug_cmdaddress,
         __mirv_debug_devicecontext

- Thanks to:
    Everyone (including you).
    iD Software, matrixstorm, MetaMod, Microsoft, Valve Software, wxWidgets.
    Uwe Gierlich for his informations about the Half-Life .dem file format.
    Mirvin_Monkey for creating the former MDT.
    neomic for his enormous work on the HLAE Gui.  
	Myself (ripieces) for wasting so much time on this project.


MDT 1.1.3.97 (2008-02-06)

- Changed: Exposed more of MDTs internas to the mdt_addresses.ini to make it
           more community friendly and increase potential for customization

MDT 1.1.3.95 (2008-02-06)

- Fixed: fixed the fix


MDT 1.1.3.93 (2008-02-05)

- Fixed: Problems / crashes with resolutions when the width was not dividable
         by 4. MDT should handle those properly now, however the performance
         of those may be a bit worse than those that are dividable by 4. (Bug
         reported by s0nkite). Please be aware that several codecs and video
         editing programs might not support these resolutions. 


MDT 1.1.3.46 (2008-02-01)

- Added: mirv_aim_offset right up forward
         Allows to set a offset relative to the entities origin and orientation.
         Example: mirv_aim_offset 0 16.5 -20 would aim behind a players head
         
- Added: __mirv_aim_maxspeed, __mirv_aim_accel, __mirv_aim_deaccel
         Those allow to adjust the camera man aiming simulation parameters.
         (Only used when mirv_aim_snapto is 0)

MDT 1.1.3.1 (2008-01-31)

The MDT Loader.exe has been updated and will try to remember some of the
settings made when launching a game with it in extended mode and will set
them for the next time. Except the selection of the loader mode all loader
settings should be remembered.


MDT 1.1.3.0 (2008-01-26)

- Added: mirv_fx_skyhd 0|1
         0 - off
         1 - on:
         MDT will look in the folder where the HL.exe of your game is located
         for the files mdtskyrt.bmp, mdtskybk.bmp, mdtskylf.bmp, mdtskyft.bmp,
         mdtskyup.bmp, mdtskydn.bmp and use those to replace the skybox.
         Those work basically the same like the original skies, except that they
         are 24 bit TrueColor bitmaps, can have a higher resolution
         (i.e. 512x512) and are turned upside-down.
         This MDT version will include a example sky for testing and
         understanding. For later versions refer to the HLAEwiki instead then.

- Greetz: C-M | s0nkite for going on my nerves and wanting a friggin
          High Defintion skybox feature in MDT and creating the example sky.


MDT 1.1.2.21 (2008-01-10)

- Fixed: crashbug after recording when using sound export with the latest
         Steam update.

MDT 1.1.2.20 (2008-01-10)

- Fixed: adapted MDT to the latest Steam update.
         If you happen to find features of MDT that are still broken, then
         please report those to the forum:
         http://www.madabouthats.org/code-mdt/index.php

- Fixed: some minor changes in the handling of the mdt_addresses.ini

With kind regards
the MDT team.


MDT 1.1.2.0 (2008-01-10)

- Added: mirv_movie_noadverts 0|1
         You need to start recording before you can see a difference.
         This allows to remove the InGame Advertisements (IGAs) in levels
         during movie recording.
         

MDT 1.1.1.96 (2008-01-05)

- Fixed: Flaw in new matte system that would cause problems with detail
  textures.

Note, you might need to disable r_detailtextures in case you use the
mirv_fx_lightmap feature.


MDT 1.1.1.87 (2007-12-30)

- Changed: The matte system to avoid some problems with players not masked in
           the entity stream. In case the new method is causing problems you
           can use the old method by setting __mirv_movie_oldmatte 1

- Changed: mirv_movie_simulate
           0 - anything is saved to disk
           1 - nothing is saved to disk(only simulate)
           2 - except the splitstreams (all / world / matte) anything
               additionally activated is still exported, useful if you only
               want to capture sound i.e. and don't want the images (although
               I wonder why you want sound without images)

- Added: mirv_fx_lightmap (experimental)
         0 = off (default), 1 = show light maps, 2 = fullbright (no light maps)

- Changed: mirv_movie_only_entity now tries to mask other entities instead of
           hiding them


MDT 1.1.1.0 XMAS 2007 (2007-12-24)

Hello, this is a special Christmas release :D

At first we want to hint you to the HLAEwiki*, which already contains the Mirv
Demo Tool command reference and will be extended in the future:
http://www.hhg-clan.de/hlae/wiki

Along some bonus tools you normally have to download separately (check the bonus
folder in the zip) we also added some sweet extra candy to MDT itself:

A build in WallHack system : P

mirv_fx_wh_enable 0|1
  Default: 0
  Enable / Disable built in wh system.
  
  The wall hack system WILL ONLY WORK PROPERLY WHEN MDT IS IN RECORDING MODE:
  To preview the final result you can use mirv_movie_simulate 1 (please
  reffer to the HLAEwiki entry for more info on that command).
  
  All transparency stuff is not applied to the entity stream, but all other
  streams. So there will be problems with the world depthdump when the wh is
  enabled, because the z-Buffer check on walls is disabled to make the wh work.

mirv:fx_wh_alpha 0.0 - 1.0
  Default: 0.5
  Controls the alpha blending value of the walls (higher value = less
  transparency)
  
mirv_fx_wh_additive 0|1
  Default: 1
  If enabled this blends the walls additive. The non additive mode (0) might
  look a bit wrong in some cases due to OpenGL limitations (polygons overlap
  in wrong order) but still looks good I guess, so try both : )
  
mirv_fx_wh_noquads 0|1
  Default: 0
  If enabled it makes some things like sprites etc. completely invisible.
  
mirv_fx_wh_tint_enable 0|1
  Default: 0
  If enabled the walls etc. will be tinted in a specific color you
  can supply with the mirv_fx_wh_tint_colorf command.
  
mirv_fx_wh_tint_colorf 0.0-10.0 0.0-1.0 0.0-1.0
  Default: 0.0 0.5 1.0
  Allows to set a specific color for tinting the walls.
  The 3 values are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0
  The order is R G B.
  
mirv_fx_wh_xtendvis 0|1
  Default: 1
  When enabled, this forces Half-Life to ignore the visibility checks.
  This means you can see all walls and this is especially helpful
  for HLTV demos, because in those you can see the CTs at their spawn
  from the T spawn on de_dust2 and so on xD
  (The use for in-eye demos is limited, except that your player hacked the
  server :P
  So in case the wh shows too much walls, then set it to 0, so you will
  have the default H-L vis check enabled again :)
  

Thanks and greets too:

C-M|s0nkite ( www.mattepainting.gr )
  for supplying the merry_xmas.jpg that is included in the download!
  
msthavoc ( www.mst-gaming.de )
  for helping now and then with testing mdt and making tutorials :)

  
  
Merry X-Mas to you guys then,
have fun, cya next year.

* it's HLAEwiki, because MDT might get renamed in the far away future to
  Half-Life Advanced Effects : )
  

MDT 1.1.0.29 (2007-12-08)

- Fixed: Various bugs that would affect stereo camera captures and
         mirv_movie_cameraofs_cs.
         
- Fixed: Bug that would cause MDT to ignore the pEngfuncs entry in the
         addresses.ini config file on initialization.
         
- Changed: Default values for stereo cam mode, but you might want to use your
           own anyways.

- Thanks: msthavoc (mst-gaming.de) for testing.


MDT 1.1.0.25 (2007-11-02)

- Fixed: Typo that would prevent the aiming system from ever being turned off.

- Fixed: The aiming system assumed entities to be dead to early due to lack of
         updates from the H-L network stream when it was paused (i.e. due to
         dem_pause 1).
         The aiming system now tries to detect, if the stream is paused.
         However the detection is not perfect yet plus there might be still
         problems when using very high fps when recording.


MDT 1.1.0.0 (2007-10-25)

Well there have been so many additions to MDT in the past, so that is why we
are counting the minor version number 1up :)

But even better there is some candy in it:

- Added: mirv_movie_export_sound 0|1
         If set to 1 the experimental sound recording system is enabled which
         will record the sound to a .wav in 22.050 kHz 16 Bit stereo quality.
         It is recommended to turn s_eax and s_a3d of (set both to 0.0),
         because it wasn't designed for those, but you can try if you want :)
         With mirv_sound_volume (default 0.5) you can control the
         clamping of the sound before it is outputted (this is necessary to
         avoid hitting the peeks). The default value should be ok.

- Greetz: everyone that wants to be greeted + GabeN + MartinO :P

Cheers!


MDT 1.0.60.251 (2007-10-20)

- Added: mirv_movie_simulate 0|1
         If set to 1 recording will not create any files (simulation mode), if
         it runs too fast you can supply an additional delay in milli seconds
         with mirv_movie_simulate_delay (1000 ms = 1 sec), be careful with
         the delay ;)
         
- Thanks: cRZYFST (style-productions.net)


MDT 1.0.60.249 (2007-10-18)

- Changed: exporting motion data in stereo mode will create two files now since
           several programs had problems with handling BVH files with two roots
           (not to mention an typo that was present in stereo mode heh).

- Thanks: msthavoc for testing.


MDT 1.0.60.248 (2007-10-18)

- Changed: internal changes to the address config system.

- Changed: removed dependency on msvcp71.dll

- Added: mirv_movie_export_cammotion 0|1
         creates Biovision (BVH) compatible motion data that can be imported
         i.e. in Blender and 3ds Max.
         The file will contain one root / bone named MdtCam in normal mode or
         two roots / bones named MdtCamLeft and MdtCamRight in stereo mode.
         The bone origin (head) is the view origin and the bone's end site (tip)
         points 1 Unit into the forward direction.
         Valve defines 1 Unit in H-L 1 / CS 1.6 as 1 Inch.
        

MDT 1.0.60.152 (2007-09-27)

- Added: mirv_movie_separate_hud 0|1|2
         Set to 1 if you want to have an separate hud stream (, there should be
         no hud on any of the other streams then).
         By default there is also an "hudalpha" stream which you should use
         to blend an black layer bellow and draw the "hudcolor" stream additive
         onto it (since not all HUD elements are additive).
         You can turn the hudalpha stream off if you don't need it by using
	     mirv_movie_separate_hud 2 instead.
	     
- Changed: Naming of output files to:
           Name_Take#_StreamType[_StereoType]_Frame#.tga
           
I'd say one of the craziest versions ever : P


MDT 1.0.60.41 (2007-09-23)

- Changed: New stream capturing system, now there will be no delay (was 1ms)
           between the streams anymore.
           If there are problems u can use the old one with
           __mirv_movie_oldcapture 1 (is 0 by default).
           
- Added: mirv_movie_stereomode, mirv_movie_stereo_centerdist and
         mirv_movie_stereo_yawdegrees for faking stereo captures.
         (True stereo captures would require adjustments of the projection.)
         Set mirv_movie_stereomode 1 to enable stereo capturing.

The HUD problems (only the (left) worldstream has the HUD if it is enabled)
are not solved yet and remain the same as in previous versions.


MDT 1.0.60.9 (2007-09-21)

- Added: Ini system draft. Currently addresses can be changed manually.

MDT 1.0.60.7 (2007-09-13)

- Fixed: Valve's Steam community release broke MDT.
         We (MIRVIN_Monkey, ripieces, neomic) hope this update makes MDT
         working for you again :)


MDT 1.0.60.0 UNOFFICIAL (2007-09-11)

- Added: Capability to force resolutions, currently focused on windowed mode.
         The loader has been extended to reflect and support those additions.
         You will find a GUI for forcing specific resolutions when you switch
         the MDT loader to extended mode.
         Note: There are problems with forcing fullscreen (windowed mode is
         recommended). Also the color depth seems to be limited to the desktop
         depth or the last depth you selected in your game. And the Height has
         to be 480 Pixels or greater. And the ingame isn't adjusted (You will
         see what I mean when using an extreme Widht and a small Height).
         However the bottom line is: You wanted to be able to force wide
         screen resolutions (i.e. 800x500) and here it is (and it wasn't 
         too easy :)
         
- Thanks: msthavoc (Cyanide-Pictures.de) for testing

- Greets: code-mdt forum Guys :)


MDT 1.0.59.0 UNOFFICIAL (2007-09-03)

- Changed: changed the capture point of images and the matte color clearing

- Changed: modified detection of game resolution

- Changed: MDT now automatically forces gl_ztrick 0 by default in order to make
  sure depthdumps retrieve normalized depthdata

- Added: __mirv_gl_force_noztrick, __mirv_gl_noclear for debugging (you should
  leave them on the default values)

- Removed: __mirv_depth_fixempty

- Thanks: really big thanks to msthavoc (Cyanide-Pictures.de) for helping with
          testing and providing his system for tests :-)


MDT 1.0.58.309 DLL UNOFFICIAL (2007-08-28)

- Fixed: mirv_cameraofs_cs should now work in ineye demos too

- Thanks: msthavoc (Cyanide-Pictures.de) for testing


MDT 1.0.58.268 DLL UNOFFICIAL (2007-08-26)

- Added: mirv_cameraofs_cs
         Can be used in Counter-Strike 1.6 to move the final view in x y z,
         I.e. mirv_cameraofs_cs 1.5 0 -10 would move the view 1.5 units to the
         right and 10 units backwards.
         This can be usefull if you want to do stereo captures, because in this
         case you could record a scene twice and use a negative x value in the
         first pass to move the camera slighlty left and a positive x value in
         the second pass to move the camera slightly right.

- Thanks: msthavoc (Cyanide-Pictures.de)


MDT 1.0.58.158 DLL UNOFFICIAL (2007-08-03)

- Added: __mirv_depth_fixempty (default 0)
         If you have one of those card's where you get an empty DepthDump
         (because those have problems with GL_FLOAT) you can try
         __mirv_depth_fixempty 1
         GL (this will try to retrieve the depth with GL_UNSIGNED_INT instead
         However if 0 works fine for you take 0, 1 is slower!

- Changed: tried to reduce impact of Half-Life Client timing problems on the
           mirv_zoom_ stuff by preventing changes when deltatime gets negative
           (meaning the zoom will not pop back anymore and will stay fully
           zoomed when u are zoomed in, however on zooming stuttering can
           still occur)

- Hint: this seems to be a common problem with HLTV demos, althoug it's hardly
        noticeable:
        the client timing problems (which also happen when not using MDT) can
        also cause player models to stutter etc. (we don't know if and when we
        can fix it, since the origin of the problem is probably on Valve's end).
        However you can reduce stuttering when setting cl_clockreset to a value
        higher than the number of seconds the scene you want to record lasts.
        (I.e. if you plan to record bellow 1 minute you can set it to 60,
        however we have no idea what side effects this could cause, so may be
        note the default value first before changing it (I think it's 0.1 or
		so)).
         
- Added: mirv_crop_height (default -1)
         -1 means no (height) cropping will be applied
         you can specify an outputheight you want the images to be cropped to.
         (if you have a black line at the top of your images you can use this
         to cut it off by suppling the correct value (you can leave
         mirv_crop_yofs on -1 in this case)).
         
- Added: mirv_crop_yofs (default -1)
         -1 will automatically center any cropping action (so you can easily
         crop 4:3 down to 16:9 and stuff like that), other values crop value
         lines of from the top

- Changed: mirv_matte_setcolor (renamed from the BE mirv_matte_setcolour) now
           accepts values from 0 - 255 (r g b), like it was before MDT 1.0
           
- Added: mirv_matte_setcolorf - this allows directly setting the color using
         the usual GL float values (0.0 - 1.0)

- Added: In order to improve the fix for avoiding empty dumps that occurred on
         some grfx cards (ATI Radeon X800, ASUS ATI x1600xt, Geforce FX 5600,
         ...) a system has been added to force GL to read from and draw to
         specific buffers. This system is enabled by default now and set to
         work on the GL_BACK buffer. You can control and even turn off this
         system with the new __mirv_forcebuffers command (type it in console
         and press enter for more infos)

- Removed: mirv_movie_fixemptydumps is now obsolete (due to the new system)

- Added: __mirv_info:
         People should use this command and copy the info it prints to the
         console when reporting bugs.
         
- Thanks: For testing and reporting details about bugs:
          msthavoc (Cyanide-Pictures.de), dios (hanshenschel.de)


MDT 1.0.58.87 DLL UNOFFICIAL (2007-07-10)

- Added: mirv_fixemptydumps:
         Several ATI card users reported problems with empty MDT output when
         AntiAliasing is enabled (i.e. ATI Radeon X800 or  asus ati x1600xt
         both Catalys 7.6). This hopefully fixes it, you can also try this
         option if you have problems with other cards.
         values: 0(Default), 1=enable fix (seems to work fine with AAx2 and
         AAx4 however on a Radeon X800 there are problems with AAx6 (messed
         up image)

- Added: mirv_depth_logarithmic; Values:  0 = use linear scale (old method),
         any other x = use a logrithmic scale where x specifies how fast the
         distance grows, default     : 32

- Thanks: Thanks to Slize (Creative-Movies.de) for testing and feedback and
          especially entrioN (AirWalk-Media.com) for a massive amount of testing
          related to the empty dumps problem, thx guys!


MDT 1.0.57.0 DLL (2007-05-30)

- This is where this changelog starts.


---- historical changelogs appended bellow ----


30-05-07 - v1.0 (1.0.57.0)

Fixed: MDT has had a pretty big rewrite and so a lot of bugs are now fixed. If
       you've ever had problems with matte, splitstreams, zooming, or anything
       else then give these another try.

Added: A new loader! The old one is still available here:
       http://www.madabouthats.org/downloads/mdt-old-loader.zip
       Please email me if you have trouble with the new one.

Added: mirv_fixforcehltv 0|1 cvar.
       This fixes the fact that if you watch one of your own demos with
       dem_forcehltv 1 (which lets you watch it as if its a hltv demo) you
       can't see your own player. Now you can, hurray.

Added: mirv_movie_wireframe 0|1|2|3 cvar.
       mirv_movie_wireframelength n
       Lets you draw the world (1), entities (2) or everything (3) in retro
       wireframes.

Changed: Depth dumping now dumps separate world and entity dumps if you are
         using splitstreams.

Changed: mirv_matte_setcolor r g b
         Now takes values from 0 to 100.

Changed: mirv_zoom_max n
         This has now become: mirv_zoom_optical n and
                              mirv_zoom_digital n
         Both takes values 0 to 100.

Changed: mirv_movie_customdumps
         This is now ON by default.

Changed: mirv_movie_clearscreen
         This is now OFF by default

         
24-05-07 - v0.44
Added: mirv_fixforcehltv - draws your player model when dem_forcehltv is enabled with
       viewdemo. Now you can have hltv-style shots from your very own first person demos!
Change: Various improvements under the hood
Fixed: Viewport getting out of sync

21-05-07 - v0.43
Change: Removed the singleplayer-only cvar fix since it broke some demos.

17-05-07 - v0.42
Added: Allowed singleplayer-only cvars to work while playing demos
       (e.g. gl_wireframe, gl_drawentities, etc)
Fixed: Some buffer overflows

19-04-07 - v0.41
Added: mirv_disableautodirector - set this to 1 if autospectator keeps stealing control from you.
       This was on by default in previous mirvs, now you'll need to set it explicitly.
Added: mirv_demoedit_fix tfc - use this command to fix the demoedit interface in TFC - thanks to ripieces
       for his involvement with this
         
14-03-07 - v0.37
Updated offsets. Still not got round to storing them in external file.
Have also un-UPX packed the loader, hopefully this will fix the false virus alarms.
