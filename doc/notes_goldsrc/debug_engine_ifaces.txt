Version: May 16 update

This requires a modification that loads a client.dll (i.e. cstrike).

Break on loading of client.dll and add the following breakpoints:

Break on client!Initialize:
[esp+4] is p_cl_enginefuncs_s.

Break on client!HUD_PlayerMoveInit:
[esp+4] is p_playermove_s.

Break on client!HUD_GetStudioModelInterface:
[esp+C] is p_engine_studio_api_s.
