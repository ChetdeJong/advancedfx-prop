This requires a modification that loads a mp.dll and that has Server_GetBlendingInterface(i.e. cstrike).

Break on loading of client.dll and add the following breakpoints:

Break on mp!GiveFnPtrsToDll:
[esp+4] is p_sv_enginefuncs.

Break on mp!Server_GetBlendingInterface:
[esp+5*4] is p_sv_enginefuncs.
