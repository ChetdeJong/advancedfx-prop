- search "Hud_UpdateClientData" c-string
- go to first reference of it
- this is where it does GetProcAddress for client!Hud_UpdateClientData
- select the variable where result is stored
- go to first reference, where it is moved into eax
- look at block after call of eax
- the fov is moved into edx and then the last mov in that block is edx into fov global
- if you found the right global it should be located before "scr_centertime" c-string.
