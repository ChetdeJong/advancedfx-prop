Parts of the HLAE source code require the Spider Monkey library to compile.1) Download SpiderMonkey 1.7.0:ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/js/js-1.7.0.tar.gz2) Extract the js folder into your libraries directory (C:\Libraries)3) Replace the file C:\Libraries\js\src\js.mak with our own one from here:http://sourceforge.net/projects/advancedfx/files/tools/hlae_spidermonkey_js_mak.zip/downloadThis file contains two important changes:a) It defines _BIND_TO_CURRENT_CRT_VERSION=1, since that is what all HLAE compile units use in order to link to the CRT (has to do with our deployment scheme).b) It has a fix so that the jsshell actually compiles4) Open the Visual Studio command prompt (i.e. from the visual studio tools menu) and enter:Code:nmake /f js.mak CFG="jsshell - Win32 Release"Now that is enough as far as compiling HLAE is concerned (for deployment you will need to copy the .dll that is compiled).
