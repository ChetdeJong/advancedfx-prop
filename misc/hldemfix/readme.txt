Half-Life Demo Fix 1.0.1 // 2006-02-20 00:00:40
================================================================================


What can it do?

  Fix Demos that are not viewable due to a crash (Viewdemo reports "WARNING!
  Demo had bogus number of directory entries!") of Counter-Strike 1.6 /
  Half-Life 1 or your PC.

  (It is designed for "normal" demos with Demo Version 5, Network Version 47,
  that have 2 Segments, using it on other Versions will result in warnings and
  is not offically supported).


What can it not do?

  Anything more than what was named above and probably never will, because
  this was not my intention.
  
  If you want other more features you might want to use Viewdemo,
  Geekplay, Skplayer, cs-eXpert Demo Player or Demofreak.
  But I didn't manage to fix my demo with those, so that is why
  Half-Life Demo Fix was born.

Changelog:

2006-02-20 00:00:40
  - will now allow fixing of demos even if directory rentries are already
    present

2006-01-15 13:00 1.0.0.0
  - first public release
