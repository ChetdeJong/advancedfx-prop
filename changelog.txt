1.0.58.87 DLL UNOFFICIAL

- Added: mirv_fixemptydumps:
         Several ATI card users reported problems with empty MDT output when
         AntiAliasing is enabled (i.e. ATI Radeon X800 or  asus ati x1600xt
         both Catalys 7.6). This hopefully fixes it, you can also try this
         option if you have problems with other cards.
         values: 0(Default), 1=enable fix (seems to work fine with AAx2 and
         AAx4 however on a Radeon X800 there are problems with AAx6 (messed
         up image)

- Added: mirv_depth_logarithmic; Values:  0 = use linear scale (old method),
         any other x = use a logrithmic scale where x specifies how fast the
         distance grows, default     : 32

- Thanks: Thanks to C-M|Slize for testing and feedback and especially
          AM|entrioN for a massive amount of testing related to the empty
          dumps problem, thx guys!
